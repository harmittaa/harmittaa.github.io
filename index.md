## Mobile software engineer

I am a mobile software engineer, currently mainly focusing on Android, but absolutely willing to spend most of my time on either platform. I am passionate about being creative, yet I still try to bring an engineer's perspective into my work: investigating, planning, executing, evaluating.

Projects I've been working on have been published on both on the App Store and Google Play, and are used by tens of thousands of users. My non-work related projects include image processing, machine learning, AR - all on mobile.

I am currently spending my time between my Master's studies in Computer Science in Aalto Univeristy and my work as a mobile software engineer in ePassi Payments Oy.
