## Mobile software engineer

I am currently mainly focused on Android, but absolutely willing to spend my time working on either platform. I am passionate about being creative, yet I still try to bring an engineer's perspective into my work: investigating, planning, executing, evaluating.

For both platforms I've worked on projects from scratch, to publishing them for tens of thousands of users to use, and to finally ironing out the bugs. My non-work related projects include image processing, machine learning, AR - all on mobile.

I am currently spending my time between my Master's studies in Computer Science in Aalto Univeristy and my work as a mobile software engineer in ePassi Payments Oy.
